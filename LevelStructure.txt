CREATE A LEVEL:
    1. Create Scene with name "Level_XX"
    2. Move Prefab LevelLoader into 
    3. Create Emptys "Tiles" and "Pieces"
    4. Move Pieces and Tiles, that should be in the level, in the Emptys
        TILES HAVE TO BE IN THE GRID
        Pieces that are placed bellow the grid  (y <= -1) have to be placed by the player
        Pieces that are on the grid (y >= 0) can not be replaced by the player
        x=0 and y=0 is the origin of the grid

THINGS THAT HAPPEN AT LEVEL START:
    1. LevelLoader Spawns a few objects like the UI and GameManager
    2. The GameManager corrects wrong coordinates
        The "Tiles" and "Pieces" Emptys get set to x=0, y=0 z=CorrectLayer
        The x and y values from Tiles and Pieces get rounded to ints
        The z value relative to the parrent Emptys from Tiles and Pieces get set to z=0
    3. The GameManager reads the GameObjects from the scene and creates
        internal Lists/Dicts where which tile and piece is placed
    4. The GameManager calles the 'Init' Methods from the Tiles and Pieces
