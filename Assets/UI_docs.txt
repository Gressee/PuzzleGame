UI Rules:
    1. Every UI element that us used at least twice 
        becomes a Prefab.
    2. Every Button gets its own script in that the 
        button function is coded.
    3. Canvases get named  "UI_SomeName"
    4. If in a scene a script for ui is needed that can't be
        placed in a button the canvas gets a script named like the canvas.
